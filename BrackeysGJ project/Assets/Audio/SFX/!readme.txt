Sfx are done =D

I hope you enjoy.

the files are in *ogg 

the master is in -6db, so you have headroom to mix in the way that you like.

I made some variations for the sounds to shot randomically.

Wall slide (or slip) is a loop, and has no variatons.

The footsteps and the ladder just sync with the movement.

If you need that i can change something just callme in discord.

I think that in the future we can use fmod studio to create integration with unity, you will save your time coding... I already use with other teams.
